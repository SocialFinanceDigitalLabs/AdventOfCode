# AdventOfCode

This is Social Finance's working repository for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

The best way of getting started is to head over to 

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SocialFinanceDigitalLabs/AdventOfCode/master?filepath=solutions/2019

Another great service is [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com). You can launch your own Jupyter Notebooks on the Azure cloud without installing any software. You can log in with your SocialFinance username and password. 

If you're more inclined to try these in Javascript, why not try [Alfie](https://alfie.prodo.ai)? You can link your Alfie account to your GitHub ID.
