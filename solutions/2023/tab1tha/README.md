## Setup
- `poetry install` to install and resolve dependencies.

## Run
- `pytest` to check that all implemented functions run as expected.
Individual solutions can be run to produce answers by doing `python name_of_file.py`. For example, you can get the answer of day one's part one by running `python day1\part1.py`

## Log
### day 1
Began test-driven development. 
### day 2
Implemented python regex instead of manually string parsing.
Stabilised (abstracted) names of input and test files so they don't have to change each day.
### day 3
Actively used the debugger instead of print statements.
