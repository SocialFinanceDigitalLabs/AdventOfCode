# To code

- Duplicate the directory `day_template` and rename it for your day with preceding 0 (so second day would be `02` and 21th day would be `21`);
- Fill the `test.txt` and `final.txt` with the challenge data;
- Replace the code in the functions `part_1` and `part_2` with your solutions and make sure they return the solution (so it is printed to the console).

# To run

```console
python run.py <DAY_TO_RUN> <PART_TO_RUN> <FILE_TO_RUN>
```

## Examples
run the first day solution for part 1, with test data:

```console
python run.py 1 1 test.txt
```

run the third day solution for part 2, with final data:

```console
python run.py 3 2 final.txt
```
